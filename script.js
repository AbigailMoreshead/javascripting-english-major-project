// script.js for The JavaScripting English Major
//
// This is a JavaScript file where you can type up your JavaScript
// that will get processed by the file index.html, as you can see
// on line 15 of index.html. Lines 12–14 of that file import the 
// jQuery library (https://jquery.com/), which means you use
// jQuery in this file.
//
// Because these lines begin with “//,” they are commented out,
// that is, ignored by the browser. Hence, in order to rewrite the
// contents of the “results-div,” you can uncomment the line below:

// $("#results-div").html("Hello from scripts.js!");
